# MarkdownIntro<a name="sid3115371428123433755"></a>
Markdown is a widelly used markup language. It appeals to many people because of its readable syntax in its source form, portability and the adoption of it by many websites. Github as an example has already adopted markdwon support in all of its website, it can be used in commit messages, pull request descriptions or as the source for a Github page.

To take part of all of these advantages we have implemented a markdown language for mbeddr platform. This was developed with two major use cases in mind: As a generation target for your languages (it is not really intended for writting markdown documents inside MPS) and as the output format for your documents written with mbeddr documentation language (more on that in a second).

At the current moment this language supports all of the Markdown basic syntax ([https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)) and for those cases where Markdown can't cover your needs you can always embed html code into your markdown document.

For a long time mbeddr platform comes with a documentation language that supports a close integration with MPS languages and models. Besides plain text, chapters, sections and other means to scructure your documents it also allows referencing MPS nodes, or even embedding them into your document as images or text. Documents can be generated to HTML, Latex and now also Mardown.

By the way, it might bot be noticeable, but this document itself was written with MPS documentation language and exported to Markdown :).
